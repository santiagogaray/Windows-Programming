I included an extra feature that enables the user to select 
combo ingredients in the pizza.
So the color/taste system works near the same than
in general pizza tastes but in addition, when two different
tastes types are selected (e.g. lobster and peppers)
the color is composed by the mix of the different rgb channels.
You can easely switch bettween "Pizza tastes" and "Combo tastes"
and use the system you prefer.
