The "Computer" button was included in the game.
When this button is pressed the computer detects
which figure is to brawn next (circle or cross) and
"thinks" for a reasonable location to place it.
So, as you can press it at any time, you can:
-1. Play against the computer.
-2. Make the computer make a desicion for you.
-3. Make the computer play against itself.
